Advanced SQL: MySQL for Ecommerce & Web Analytics

This course is unlike anything you’ve seen before, guaranteed. Instead of using random sample data and obscure demos, we’ll be working with a rich, custom-built eCommerce database that we’ve designed from scratch to help you apply your SQL skills to real projects and learn how to truly THINK like an analyst.



You’ll be playing the role of a newly hired Database Analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an eCommerce start-up, and will be working directly with the CEO, Marketing Director and Website Manager to help grow the business and analyze performance along the way. You'll use a range of advanced SQL tools and techniques, and work through actual projects that data analysts and business intelligence professionals work on every day.
